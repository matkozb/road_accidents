ðŸš— New Road Accident Analysis Dashboard: 2021-2022 ðŸš—

I'm excited to share my latest project where I developed a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022. This dashboard aims to provide valuable insights into road safety and accident trends. Here are the key features:

Analyzing Road Accident from 2021-2022. Interactive Excel dashboard can be found here.

âœ… Primary KPIs:
Total casualties after accidents
Casualties by accident severity
Vehicle type involvement

âœ… Secondary KPIs:
Casualties by road type and surface
Comparison of monthly casualty trends between 2021 and 2022

âœ… Additional Insights:
Maximum casualties by vehicle type
Distribution by area, location, and time of day

This project utilizes advanced data analysis techniques to help stakeholders like the Ministry of Transport, Police, and Emergency Services make data-driven decisions to improve road safety.
